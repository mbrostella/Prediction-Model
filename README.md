# Prediction-Model
In October 2021, I participated in the DataScience Competition with IE.

We were given Dataset of space objects with several csv's to merge and were completely free of chosing the algorithms we wanted to go with. We were to classify every objects into either "Quasar", "Star", or "Galaxy".

I've coded from scratch a various models to test the effectiveness of the prediction. I tested with a Decision tree classifier, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost before arriving at the most efficient method I tried which was Support Vector Machine. This final model gave me an accuracy of ~95%.
